          Here, you can add any notes you want, so you can easily come back to
          it later and modify it as you see fit.

        <p>
          Just write what you want to have as the basics for your creation. Hair
          color, race, age, height, anything you can think of, really!

        This is a work in progress, and hopefully things will be added to it
        later, where you will be able to get ideas for what you can add to your
        charcter design.
